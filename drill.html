In 2022, some[who?] connected the pro-gun content of the genre to real world gun violence on the streets of New York and other major cities, given the violence surrounding a number of drill artists like the late Tdott Woo,[61] the late Pop Smoke, the late Chii Wvttz,[62] and gun violence victim Nas Blixky.[63][64] A shooting by alleged attempted murderer C Blu, who is signed to Interscope Records, also gave rise to concerns, echoing the 1990s era gangsta rap controversy.[65]

<p  style="color: #141edc;font-family: cursive"><b><u><mark>Drill is a subgenre of hip hop music</u> that originated in Chicago in the early 2010s. It is sonically similar to the trap music subgenre and lyrically similar to the gangsta rap subgenre. Artists within drill music have been noted for their style of lyricism and association with crime</mark> in Chicago. The genre progressed into the American mainstream in 2012 following the success of rappers like Chief Keef, Lil Durk, Lil Reese, Fredo Santana, G Herbo, Lil Bibby, and King Louie who had many local fans and a significant internet presence alongside producer Young Chop. Media attention and the signing of drill musicians to major labels followed. Chief Keef, in particular, is considered the primary progenitor and popularizer of drill music, responsible for bringing it to the mainstream.[2] After the initial momentum from the early 2010s somewhat subsided, Chicago drill had a resurgence in the late 2010s, (c. 2018) with artists such as King Von, Polo G and also with a renewed Lil Durk, also influencing many local artists.[3][4][5][6]

<mark>A regional subgenre UK drill emerged in London particularly in the district of Brixton, beginning in 2012. UK drill rose to prominence by mid-2012 and has influenced other regional scenes, such as Australian, Spanish, Irish, Dutch, and Brooklyn drill (re-introduced to Brooklyn in the late 2010s).[7][8][9]

The lyrics of drill tend to be violent and gritty. The Guardian's Lucy Stehlik said "nihilistic drill reflects real life where its squeaky-clean hip-hop counterparts have failed."[10] Drill lyrics strongly contrast with the subject matter of earlier Chicago rappers[11] and contemporary mainstream hip hop which at the time of drill's emergence tended to glorify and celebrate a rise to wealth.[12]

<mark>Drill lyrics typically reflect life on the streets, and tend to be gritty, violent, realistic and nihilistic. Drill rappers use a grim, deadpan delivery,[13] often filtered through Auto-Tune, influenced by the "stoned, aimless warbling of Soulja Boy (one of the earliest non-local Keef collaborators) and Lil Wayne before him."[14] Atlanta-based rappers Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka Flame were important influences on the drill scene.[15] Though it bears many similarities to trap music the speed of a drill beat is generally slower with a moderate tempo having about 60 to 70 beats per minute.[16][17] Some producers work at double tempo such as 120 to 140 beats per minute.

Drillers tend to be young; many prominent musicians in the scene started getting attention while still in their teens.[18] One of the genre's most prominent musicians, Chief Keef, was 16 when he signed a multi-million dollar record contract with Interscope,[19] and in an extreme example, Lil Wayne co-signed the 13-year-old driller Lil Mouse.[20] Critics have noted drill rappers' lack of concern with metaphor or wordplay. Chief Keef said that his simplistic flow is a conscious stylistic choice: "I know what I'm doing. I mastered it. And I don't even really use metaphors or punchlines. 'Cause I don't have to. But I could. ... I think that's doing too much. I'd rather just say what's going on right now. ... I don't really like metaphors or punchlines like that."[21] Whet Moser wrote that Keef's songs are "lyrically, rhythmically, and emotionally diminished, which is why they sound so airless and claustrophobic ... It's not even fatalistic, because that would imply a self-consciousness, a moral consideration, that isn't there in the lyrics. It just is, over and over again."[22] A profile on the scene in The New York Times examined the genre's aggression:

    With rare exception this music is unmediated and raw and without bright spots,</mark> focused on anger and violence. The instinct is to call this tough, unforgiving and concrete-hard music joyless, but in truth it's exuberant in its darkness. Most of its practitioners are young and coming into their creative own against a backdrop of outrageous violence in Chicago, particularly among young people—dozens of teenagers have been killed in Chicago this year—and often related to gangs. (There's a long history of overlap between Chicago’s gangs and Chicago’s rap.) That their music is a symphony of ill-tempered threats shouldn't be a surprise.[12]

Stehlik called drill production style the "sonic cousin to skittish footwork, southern-fried hip-hop and the 808 trigger-finger of trap."[10] Young Chop is frequently identified by critics as the genre's most characteristic producer.[23][24][25] The sound of trap producer Lex Luger's music is a major influence on drill,[15][24][26] and Young Chop identified Shawty Redd, Drumma Boy, and Zaytoven as important precursors to drill.[25]
